🌊 Student Well-Being Reminder 🌊
You're crushing it with early mornings, school, swim training, tuition, and coding projects!
Key Tips:
- Prioritize 7-8 hours sleep after 8 PM study—your butterfly stroke needs recovery!
- Take 5-min breaks hourly: stretch, hydrate, breathe deep.
- Fuel smart: protein post-swim, no screens 30 min before bed.
- Celebrate small wins: a clean React component or PB in the pool.
Balance academics + passions = unstoppable you. You've got this! 💪
